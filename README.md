Title: Energy Optimization in Smart Homes using Krill Herd Algorithm

Description:
Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Energy Optimization in Smart Homes project, where we employ the Krill Herd Algorithm to enhance energy consumption efficiency in the context of smart homes. Our primary goal is to improve the quality of life within these homes by optimizing energy consumption while reducing power usage. This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers, engineers, and enthusiasts interested in advancing the field of energy management in the era of smart homes.

Project Focus:
Our project places a significant emphasis on energy consumption optimization, particularly within the framework of smart homes. The central piece of our model is the 'cIndex' objective function. We've designed it with a multi-objective approach in mind, with two primary objectives:

Enhancing Comfort Index: We believe that a truly smart home should not only save energy but also prioritize the comfort and well-being of its residents. Our 'cIndex' objective function takes into account various factors that influence comfort, including temperature, lighting, and appliance usage. By optimizing these parameters, we aim to create an environment where occupants enjoy an improved quality of life.

Reducing Power Consumption: We recognize the significance of energy conservation in today's world. By minimizing power consumption, we not only reduce utility bills but also contribute to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly future. Our 'cIndex' objective function incorporates algorithms to minimize energy wastage without compromising comfort.

Key Features:

Implementation of the Krill Herd Algorithm for energy optimization.
Multi-objective approach, focusing on comfort index and power consumption reduction.
Extensive documentation and codebase for easy implementation and experimentation.
